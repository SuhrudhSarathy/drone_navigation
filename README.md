Package for indoor drone navigation. Work is in progress. Refer the `version/pcl_only` branch for a working first iteration.

### TODO
- [] Better Collision Checking
- [] Extend trajectory generation using Yaw also
- [] Employ a motion primitives based local planner and a end to end exploratort Global Planner.
- [] Construct a Circular buffer for local collision checking
- [] Features for using built maps (Occupancy Grid, ESDF Maps etc.)
- [] Exploration / Indoor Applications.
