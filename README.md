# drone_navigation
A navigation package for MAV.(Work is under progress).
## Branch Updates
### Perception
1. Branch version/pcl_only uses a naive approach for perception. The crude point cloud data obtained from the drone is filtered using a PassThrough filter and and a Voxel Grid filter.
2. An octree search is used to determine collision. If there is any data point in a radius "r" around the drone, collision is detected.
#### To do
1. Collision checking using voxblox.
### Path Planning
1. Path planning is done using RRT Algorithm. The path generated by RRT is processed by a striaght Line Optimiser.
2. The path thus recieved is processed through a trajectrory optimiser, optimised as minimum jerk trjaectory and the drone follower the trajectory.
#### To do
1. Add local planner using motion primitives.
2. Add a global incremental planner.

Note: This branch will remain as such, with the following pipeline. For further updates, refer other branches.
